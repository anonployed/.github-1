## What is Neutron?
Neutron is a permissionless smart-contract platform built with Tendermint and the Cosmos SDK. It makes development of secure cross-chain applications easier and more profitable. Through Interchain Security, Neutron provides developers with the full Proof-of-Stake security of the Cosmos Hub, one of the ten most secure blockchains in existence, at a fraction of the cost of running an appchain. Smart-contracts on Neutron can be written in Rust and run on CosmWasm, which protects them from the main attack vectors used against Solidity/EVM dApps. Neutron provides convenient interfaces that smart-contracts can use to execute and track transactions on remote blockchains, trigger callbacks and retrieve data trustlessly over IBC.
